			{
				name: "Auguste Comte",
				born: {
					date: "January 19, 1798",
					location: "Montpellier, France"
				},
				died: {
					date: "September 5, 1857",
					location: "Paris, France"
				},
				male: true, // Known issues: non-progressive gendering system
				mainTheory: "The law of the three stages",
				significance: "Comte is called the <em>father of sociology</em> and credited for coining the term \"sociology\". He held the idea that all societies develop by going through three different stages: religious, metaphysical, and scientific.",
				findings: [
					"An intelligent populice was incompatible with current religions",
					"Society cannot exist without government",
					"Society requires a religion to properly function"
				],
				quote: "Know yourself to improve yourself.",
				portraitPath: "portraits/auguste-comte.jpg",
				anchor: "comte"

			{
				name: "Herbert Spencer",
				born: {
					date: "April 27, 1820",
					location: "Derby, United Kingdom"
				},
				died: {
					date: "December 8, 1903",
					location: "Brighton, United Kingdom"
				},
				male: true,
				mainTheory: "Social Darwinism",
				significance: "Herbert Spencer coined the term <em>survival of the fittest</em> (not Charles Darwin!). He saw society as an organism made of interdependent parts. Beside these details, Spencer mostly helped us by giving us the opposite of the right ideas.",
				findings: [
					"The poor are genetically inferior to the wealthy",
					"Societal problems will, and should, fix themselves without government intervention",
					"Findings developed into eugenics, the primary ideology behind nazism"
				],
				quote: "The great aim of education is not knowledge but action.",

			{
				name: "Karl Marx",
				born: {
					date: "May 5, 1818",
					location: "Trier, Germany"

					date: "March 14, 1883",

				},
				male: true,
				mainTheory: "Conflict Theory", //"<strike>Communism</strike><span style='position:absolute; right:1.6em; top:7em; transform:rotate(-5deg)'>Conflict Theory</span>",
				significance: "Karl Marx did <em>not</em> believe nature was in control of societal roles, unlike Herbert Spencer. He was adamant that people needed to be the change they wanted in society, rather than just trusting things would improve on their own.",
				findings: [
					"Society changes and improves through revolution",
					"The economy is the foundation of all the rest of society",
					"Capitalism leads to crises—specifically overproduction"
				],
				quote: "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.",

				},
				died: {
					date: "November 15, 1917",
					location: "Paris, France"
				},
				male: true,
				mainTheory: "Structural Functionalism",
				significance: "Neither Marx, Spencer, nor Comte used scientific methods in their research. Durkheim was the first to systematically apply scientific methods to sociology. He also specifically made headway on suicide research.",
				findings: [
					"People's subjective experiences are not relevant to social research",
					"Society is governed by external, coercive \"Social Facts\"",
					"The Common Consciousness, made of social facts, drives society"
				],
				quote: "When mores are sufficient, laws are unnecessary; when mores are insufficient, laws are unenforceable.",
				portraitPath: "portraits/emile-durkheim.jpg",
				anchor: "durkheim"

			{

				},
				died: {
					date: "June 14, 1920",
					location: "Munich, Germany"
				},
				male: true,
				mainTheory: "Social Stratification",
				significance: "Unlike Durkheim, Weber believed people's subjective experiences are very important to sociologists' studies. On top of that, he also believed that class, political parties, and status groups affect a person's place in society.",
				findings: [
					"Ideas are the primary differences between traditionalism and modernity",
					"Calculability, methodical behavior, and reflexivity comprise rationality",
					"The modern state is an apparatus of rules directed by a group of charismatic leaders"
				],
				quote: ". . . man would not have attained the possible unless time and again he had reached out for the impossible.",
