# [The Founders of Sociology](https://grosserly.github.io/sociology-trading-cards/)
A sociology project.

## TODO
- Horizontal scrolling + single-card design?
- Make mobile-friendly. I'm experimenting with a one-double-sided-card design for mobile where the left card flips over to reveal the right card.
- Fix broken touch support. It probably has something to do with that `z-index: -1` weirdness I did to keep the cards from appearing over the new header.
